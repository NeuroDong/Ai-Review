# Continuous Update
This repository will be updated continuously for a long time. Welcome to use this repository, raise issues, and push requests to help optimize this template to help better community members' papers get accepted.

# Review effect
Please see: [Review example of "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition"](Examples/Review_in_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition.pdf).

# Prompt Engineering
- ***Reverse Prompt Engineering (Included)***: Infer prompts through the outstanding results generated by large models. The excellent results here come from the AI Review of AAAI 2026.
- ***Few-Shot Prompting (Now available)***: In the web UI, choose "Prompt + Examples (Few-Shot)" under "Prompting mode". The app will load templates from `Prompts/` and include example reviews from `Examples/review_in_Resnet.md` and `Examples/review_in_Verified.md` to guide the model. See [few-shot prompting](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/fewshot) for background.

# Updates & News
- **[18/10/2025]** Updated the review effect samples, see [here](Examples/). These examples are generated using Few-Shot Prompting engineering techniques.
- **[06/10/2025]** The web version adds "Quick Try" (no need for users to set up API), and also allows users to set up Deepseek API.
- **[02/10/2025]** Updated the function of using Ai Review on the web page.
- **[20/09/2025]** Added math symbol and formula checks to enforce vulnerabilities.
- **[14/09/2025]** Added a review example in "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition".
- **[14/09/2025]** Optimize Prompt so that Ai generates more detailed Strengths, Weaknesses, and Suggestions in the form of a secondary list.
